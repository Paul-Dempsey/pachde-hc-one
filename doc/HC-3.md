# HC-3

HC-3 is a companion for HC-1, offering easy access for up to 16 HC-1 favorites files.
If you want access to more than 16, just add another instance of HC-3.

HC-3 initially blank. Right click a button to choose an existing favorites file for that button.
If you don't have any favorites files yet, you can create one by saving from the HC-1 **Favorite** tab menu.

Once there's a file associated with the button, clicking it will load that file into the **Favorite** tab in the associated HC-1 and the LED on the button lights up.
Clicking again, and the file is forgotton in HC-1 (but the favorites remain), and the light goes off.

Any favorites file open in the companion HC-1 is automatically updated as you change the favorites in the **Favorite** tab (Add, Remove, Sort, Clear, ...). There is no undo.

To save a set of favorites files, use the options in the module Preset menu (just like loading and saving configuration of any Rack module).

If you use a favorites file from one device on another device, you'll only get the favorites that have the same name on both devices.
If the favorites file contains user presets that are no longer on the device, they are silently ignored.
