# pachde HC-One

Plugin for Haken Audio's Eagan Matrix.
The Eagan Matrix is the synth engien for a variety of hardware devices.
This includes the Haken Continuum, Continuu Mini, Eagan Matrix Module, and the Osmose from Expressive E.

It is *not* intended to be a replacement for the Haken Editor.
The intention is to build out a performance companion for the device.
Use the Haken editor to edit presets.

Modules:

- **[HC-1](HC-1.md)** Fast access to favorite presets, with knobs and CV inputs for the essential controls: Macros and the Recirculator.

- **HC2** For beta, pachde's prototyping and debugging module.
  Later this will be replaced by an additional module (or more) with additional features for the Eagan Matrix.
