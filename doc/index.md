# pachde (#d) HC One

**HC One** is a performance-oriented plugin for Haken Audio's Eagan Matrix.
The Eagan Matrix is the synth engine for a variety of hardware devices.
This includes the Haken Continuum, Continuu Mini, Eagan Matrix Module, and the Osmose from Expressive E.

**Note** Osmose has known issues when interfacing with external software.
External changes are not immediately displayed on it's screens.
Pachde does not own an Osmose or EMM, so any help testing and documenting the issues is welcome.

It is *not* intended to be a replacement for the Haken Editor.
The intention is to build out a performance companion for the device.

![HC One modules](HC-1.png)

HC-1 is the main module.
The rest are companion modules to HC-1, and require an HC-1 in the patch to do anything.
HC One modules automatically find each other, so you are free to arrange them wherever in the rack you like.
They do not have to be side-by-side like Rack expander modules.

Modules:

- **[HC-1](HC-1.md)** Fast access to favorite presets, with knobs and CV inputs for the essential controls: Macros and the Recirculator.

- **HC2** Rounding and CC map (more to come).

- **[HC-3](HC-3.md)** Manage a set of Favorites files.

- **[Pedal 1 & Pedal 2](Pedals.md)** Pedal control, virtual pedals, and pedal CV in/out.
