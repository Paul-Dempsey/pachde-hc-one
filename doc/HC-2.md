# Module HC-2

HC-2 is a hidden companion to HC-1, used for experimentation by the developer.

## CC Maps

At the bottom of the module are two live maps of the MIDI control code (cc) traffic.
The upper map is for Channel 1 (master channel) and the lower one for Channel 16 (EM control).
The maps are cleared at the start of loading a new preset.

The height of each bar relects the last received value of a particular CC.
Hover over the CC maps to see the cc, purpose, and current value of MIDI control codes with nonzero values.
Values of 127 are in red, and values of 64 are in green.
Everything else is light gray.

CC maps have proven to be useful to the developer during the development of this plugin, which involves a fair amount of poking and prodding the device to discover how things works.
It's also a bit of eye candy, so why not, if we don't need the space for something more important?
